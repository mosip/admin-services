## UI Spec migration

In 1.1.5* both Identity schema and UI spec was stored in identity_schema table. From 1.2.0 it is split into 2 different tables, identity_schema and ui_spec.
As part of sql migration script `1.2.0_master-scripts_release.sql` data split is taken care.

1. Pre-Registration UI-spec `pre-registration-demographic.json` is part of mosip-config repo in 1.1.5.* and should be manually published using masterdata UI-spec API.
2. For 1.2.0, Registration-Client UI spec is defined per process, Refer this documentation for more details 
https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/registration-client/registration-client-ui-specifications
